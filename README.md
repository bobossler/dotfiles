# Bob's Dotfiles
## A repository to hold some of my system preferences and config files

Dotfiles are customization files used to personalize your Linux/Unix system. A file is a dotfile because the name of the file will begin with a period. The period at the beginning of a filename or directory name also indicates it is a hidden file or directory. This repository contains my personal dotfiles. There is currently nothing "special" or exciting about my configurations. I have stored them here for convenience, and in case I need to use them to configure a new machine. These are also shared in the event others may find some of my configurations helpful in customizing their own dotfiles.
